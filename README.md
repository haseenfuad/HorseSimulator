# HorseRaceSimulator


<h3> Program Description </h3>

This program provides a simulated horse racing experience where users can customize and race their horses. Each horse can be personalized with various breeds, colors, accessories, names, symbols, and confidence levels. The race dynamics consider the horse's confidence level, which affects its speed and the likelihood of stumbling during the race. Wins boost a horse's confidence, while falls reduce it.

Users have the option to modify their horse's attributes and view both race history and horse statistics within the application.


<h3> Setup Steps </h3>

After downloading the HorseRaceSimulator folder from GitHub, navigate to the part2 folder. This folder contains three Java files: raceGui.java, Horse.java, and Race.java, 

To launch the program, run the Race.java file in part 2. This action will open a window where you can proceed after the text files have been validated. Within the main window, you can navigate the menu bar to add horses. 

To initiate a race add horses and select track length. ( For technical issues the program does not work with all the part 1 and folders together. It is recommended to run the prgoram from only part 2 from Race.java)

<h3> Dependencies </h3>

Ensure that the latest Java Development Kit (JDK) is installed on your computer. It's also recommended to use an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) like VSCode to run the program for a better user experience.
